## Assesement Given:

1. Use the GitHub API to retrieve the most starred public Python projects.  Store the list of repositories in a database table. The table must contain the  repository ID, name, URL, created date, last push date, description, and  number of stars. This process should be able to be run repeatedly and  update the table each time. 
Useful links from the GitHub API documentation: 
https://developer.github.com/v3/ 
https://developer.github.com/v3/search/ 
2. Using the data in the table created in step 1, create a web application that  displays a list of the GitHub repositories and allows the user to click  through to view details on each one. Be sure to include all of the fields in  step 1 â€“ displayed in either the list or detailed view. 
3. Create a README file with a description of your architecture and notes on  installation of your application. You are free to use any Python, JavaScript,  or CSS frameworks as you see fit.
